# Project Title: Advanced Text and Predictive Analysis of US Listings Using PySpark

## Description
Advanced Text and Predictive Analysis of US Listings Using PySpark is a data analytics project focused on analyzing listing data across the United States. This project leverages the power of Apache Spark, utilizing its PySpark module, to handle large datasets with complex variations and perform extensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced text processing for sentiment analysis and topic detection.

## Objective
Our primary goal is to develop predictive models capable of estimating listing prices based on key characteristics, thereby providing insights into factors that influence pricing dynamics in the U.S. while also performing sentiment analysis on key features that could influence pricing.

## Key Features and Workflow:
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Initial data cleaning to handle missing values including NaN and Null values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations between different variables.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing text columns to perform sentiment analysis, helping to understand the emotions and sentiments expressed in listing descriptions, house rules, interaction, transit, etc.
Topic Detection: Implementing clustering techniques on transit data to detect and categorize topics within the listings, which assists in identifying the prevalent transit methods across different listings.
Feature Importance and Selection: Evaluating the importance of various features in the dataset, followed by selecting the most impactful features to improve model performance.
Predictive Modeling with Decision Trees: Developing a regression model using decision trees to predict listing prices based on the selected features.
Technologies Used:
Apache Spark / PySpark: For distributed data processing.
Python: For scripting and additional data manipulation.
Tableau: For data visualization in different states across the U.S.

Purpose: This project is designed as a practical application of big data tools providing real estate analytics, suitable for academic purposes, real estate market analysis, and data science training.
